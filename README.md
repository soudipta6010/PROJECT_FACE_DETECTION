# PROJECT_FACE_DETECTION
📸 Face Detection Using OpenCV and Haar Cascades
    ->This is a simple real-time face detection project built using Python and OpenCV. It uses Haar Cascade classifiers to detect human faces via the system's webcam and highlights them with a blue rectangle in a   live video feed.

🔍 Features
    ->Real-time face detection using webcam
    ->OpenCV’s pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier
    ->Lightweight and easy to run
    ->Press q to exit the program

🛠️ Technologies Used
    ->Python 3.11+
    ->OpenCV (cv2)

🚀 How It Works
    ->The script captures video from the system's default webcam.
    ->Each frame is converted to grayscale.
    ->Haar Cascade is applied to detect faces.
    ->Detected faces are highlighted with a rectangle.
    ->The video feed is displayed in a window.
    ->Press q to exit the detection window.

📷 Output Example
    ->When a face is detected, the window will display your webcam feed with a blue rectangle around your face (or any detected face).
